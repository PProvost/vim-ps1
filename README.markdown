ps1.vim
=======

If you are a Windows PowerShell user who uses Vim or Gvim for editing scripts, 
then this plugin is for you.

It provides nice syntax coloring and indenting for Windows PowerShell (.ps1)
files, and also includes a filetype plugin so Vim can autodetect your PS1 scripts.

Includes contributions by:

* Tomas Restrepo
* Jared Parsons
* Heath Stewart
* Michael B. Smith
* Alexander Kostikov

Installation
------------

Copy the included directories into your .vim or vimfiles directory.

Or even better, use [pathogen.vim][1] and simply pull it in like this:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone https://github.com/PProvost/vim-ps1.git
    
If you use [vim-plug][4] add this to your config:

    Plug 'pprovost/vim-ps1'

Folding
-------

The ps1 syntax file provides syntax folding for script blocks and digital 
signatures in scripts.

When 'foldmethod' is set to "syntax" then function script blocks will be
folded unless you use the following in your .vimrc or before opening a script:

    :let g:ps1_nofold_blocks = 1

Digital signatures in scripts will also be folded unless you use:

    :let g:ps1_nofold_sig = 1

Note: syntax folding might slow down syntax highlighting significantly,
especially for large files.
